Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset focuses on key health metrics that have been shown to correlate with diabetes risk.

 Dataset Overview
All patients in this dataset:

Are female
Are at least 21 years old
Are of Pima Indian heritage
The dataset includes the following features:

Feature	Description
Pregnancies	Number of times the patient has been pregnant
Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration measured 2 hours into an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness	Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin	2-hour serum insulin level (mu U/ml)
BMI	Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction	A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age	Age in years
Outcome	Target variable:
0 = tested negative for diabetes
1 = tested positive for diabetes

 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:
Explore the dataset and understand feature distributions
Build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict diabetes outcomes
Analyze feature importance to understand which health indicators contribute most to prediction
